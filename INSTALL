To install Coq and Ssreflect, I highly recommend going through Opam:

    https://coq.inria.fr/howto-opam 

The library is known (to have) compiled with Coq-8.5/Ssreflect-1.5.

* Installing Coq 8.5 and Ssreflect 1.5

At the moment (pre-8.5 release cycle), this is a bit tricky. We must
first install the development version of Coq:

$ opam switch coq-8.5 --alias-of 4.01.0
$ opam repo add coq-stable https://github.com/coq/repo-stable.git
$ opam repo add coq-unstable https://github.com/coq/repo-unstable.git
$ opam repo add coqs https://github.com/coq/repo-coqs.git
$ opam install -j4 coq.dev

Then, at the time of writing, we need the Coq-contribs version of
Ssreflect:

$ git clone https://gforge.inria.fr/git/coq-contribs/ssreflect.git
$ cd ssreflect
$ opam pin add coq:contrib:ssreflect .

* Pinning the package

To make this package available to others in your system, pin it:

$ opam pin add coq:bits . -k git

After a modification, we simply upgrade the package:

$ opam upgrade coq:bits
